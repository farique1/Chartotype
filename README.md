# Chartotype  

***Char To Type***  
Convert and extend bitmap font dumps into a series of SVG files that are loaded into FontForge and exported as a font file.  
**Chartotype** was made to be used with pixel fonts generated by classic 8-bit and 16-bit computers. It began as a little modification to Andy Teijelo's excellent [Making an MSX font](http://www.ateijelo.com/blog/2016/09/13/making-an-msx-font) and become... something else.  

> Go read Teijelo's blog, by the way. If you are here you probably like the subject and his explanation of the process behind the code is excellent.  

> **Chartotype** was only tested on a Mac but should (could? would?) work on a Windows or Linux PC? Maybe? Tell me.  

> Also take a look at [**Vectotype**](https://github.com/farique1/Chartotype/tree/master/Vectotype) for an Illustrator template and a standalone scripts to convert SVG files into fonts.  

## How to use  

### Running  

**Chartotype** works by reading a bitmap font dump `.png` and matching it with a `.txt` file with *unicode* characters on the same order as the ones on the bitmap, left to right, top to bottom. It will save enlarged B&W `.bmp` versions of the bitmap character and convert each of them to `.svg`. Then, it generates another script to be read inside **FontForge** that will load the `.svg` and create the font file.  

To run the program, open Terminal and go to the **Chartotype** folder. There, run the `Chartotype-A.py` program with the *font* or *system* name as argument.  

`Chartotype-A.py <sys_name> [0|1|2|3]`  

After the system name there can be a multipurpose argument in the form of a single digit from `0` to `3`  
`0` run the program without feedback  
`1` writes a dot for each converted character (default)  
`2` returns complete information on every character converted  
`3` (**not implemented yet** generate only  `Chartotype-B.py` without processing the bitmaps and SVGs)  

### What is needed  

**Chartotype** was developed on Python 2.7 and needs:  
- [**potrace**](http://potrace.sourceforge.net) (the `potrace` executable must be on the `Chartotype` folder)
- The [**Pillow**](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#) Python library  
- [**FontForge**](https://fontforge.github.io/en-US/)  

Inside the **Chartotype** folder there must be sub folders with the name (no spaces) of the intended systems or fonts to be converted. This will be called `sys` from now on.  

Inside the `sys` folder there must be:  

A bitmap font dump `.png` with the characters on a regular grid, cropped to the exact bounding size called `sysCharMap.png`  

![CoCo character map](https://github.com/farique1/Chartotype/blob/master/CoCo/CoCoCharMap.png?raw=true)  

A *unicode* encoded text file following the bitmap character sequence called `sysCharMap.txt`  
```
 !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_↑abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~←█▛▜▀▙▌▚▘▟▞▐▝▄▖▗▒
 ```

Also in this folder there must be a file called `sysChartotype.ini` (copy one of the examples) with the following content:  

`[BITMAP]` Section with information about the bitmap cropping and `.bmp` and `.svg` saving settings.  
`char_width =` `NUMBER` The characters horizontal size in pixels.  
`char_height =` `NUMBER` The characters vertical size in pixels.  
`trim_width =` `NUMBER` An horizontal crop factor (in pixels, from the right) for the character (ie. on MSX screen 0 mode the characters are 6x8 versions cropped from the 8x8 originals. The same 8x8 characters bitmap can be used to generate both sets)  
`trim_height =` `NUMBER` Same as above but vertical (from the bottom)  
`resize_factor =` `NUMBER` A factor to scale the bitmap for better vector interpretation. `8` works well.  
`invert_luma =` `BOOLEAN` **Chartotype** tries to distinguish between the foreground and background color to generate a back and white `.bmp` with the font in black even on systems where the font is lighter than the background. However, If the colors are still inverted change this to `True` otherwise use `False`  

`[FONT]` Section with configuration for the export font file .  
`glyph_width =` `NUMBER` The width of the exported font characters (the font will be monospaced).  
`ascent =` `NUMBER` The capital letter height of the output font. (To help the calculation this number can be on the format `NUMBER - NUMBER`, the first number being the full font height and the second being the `descent`)  
`descent =` `NUMBER` The portion below the font baseline (the lower part of the lowercase "g" for instance)  

> It is recommended the height to be a power of 2 for TrueType fonts, usually 1024.  
> So it is common to have the `ascent = 1024 - 128`,  `descent = 128` and `glyph_width = 1024` with `width` and `descent` varying according to the font proportions.  

`fontname =` `STRING` the font name (no spaces).  
`fullname =`  `STRING` the font full name.  
`familyname =`  `STRING` the font family name.  

`[OPTIONAL]` Optional configurations for the exported font.  
`os2_ascent =` `NUMBER` An alternate ascent value.  
`os2_descent =` `NUMBER` An alternate descent value.  
`os2_linegap =` `NUMBER` A line gap value.  

> These values can be left blank.  
> They are useful if you want to add vertical (line) spacing to the font without changing its geometry. Usually, increasing the descent number is enough.  

On the **Chartotype** folder there is a `Chartotype.ini` file with general program settings with content as follows:  

`[CHARTOTYPE]`  
`auto_save =` `BOOLEAN` If `True` automatically saves the **FontForge** project and the `.ttf` font file on the `sys` folder.  
`save_report =` `BOOLEAN` If `True` saves a CSV `.txt` report with information about all the characters converted.  
`save_raw_png =` `BOOLEAN` **Chartotype** uses enlarged B&W `.bmp` files to do the conversion. If this is `True` it will also save the separated original bitmapped characters on `.png` files.  
`delete_folders =` `BOOLEAN` If `True` will delete all the working folders (except the `PNGs`) after the conversion.  

After `Chartotype-A.py` is done, if told to, a `sysReport.txt` will be generated on the `sys` folder with information about all the characters found and the `BMPs` folder will be deleted.  
Also another script will be generated/modified, `Chartotype-B.py`, with all that is needed to make the font file.  

### Chartotype-B  

`Chartotype-B.py` must be called from inside FontForge on the `File > Script Menu` menu (pasting the script straight to the `Execute Script...` box doesn't always work). Configure the `Script Menu` on `File > Preferences... > Script Menu` this only needs to be done once as long as the path to `Chartotype-B.py` doesn't change.  

Once set up, calling `Chartotype-B.py` inside **FontForge** will load each `.sgv`, assign them to their character slot, perform some optimisations and, if told to, save the project, export the font and delete the `SVGs` folder.  

At this time you may want to revise the font on **FontForge** to see if all went according to plan and maybe do some manual adjustments.  

>This is often not needed but the initial `Chartotype-A` font settings can take some trial and error to get right.  

> I specially had problems with an horizontal proportioned font (`A2600 Blocky`, one of the examples) and had to adjust it manually on **FontForge** (configuring as square (ascent+descent=width), selected all the glyphs and changed *size* and *scale* on the `Elements > Transformations > Transform...` menu, checking `Transform Width Too`)

Enjoy and send feedback.  
Thanks.  

***Chartotype** is offered as is, with no guaranties whatsoever. I think it will behave however (mostly).*
